<br><br>
<p><b>ARGININE</b> is one of the most popular pre-workout ingredients because the body readily converts it to nitric oxide (NO). </p>

<br><br>
<p><b>BETA-ALANINE</b> is an amino acid that combines with the amino acid histidine in muscle cells to form carnosine, which is critical for muscle strength.</p>

<br><br>
<p><b>BETAINE</b> is a modified amino acid known as trimethylglycine. It’s effective for boosting muscle strength and power by as much as 25% and increasing the number of reps you can do by 10 percent.</p>

<br><br>
<p><b>BRANCHED-CHAIN AMINO ACIDS</b> (BCAAs) include the three amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. They’re important for driving muscle growth, increasing energy, and blunting fatigue.</p> 

<br><br>
<p><b>CAFFEINE</b> is a powerful stimulant that increases alertness by binding to receptors in the brain. This keeps nerve activity up and fatigue down.</p> 

<br><br>
<p><b>CITRULLINE MALATE</b> is a combo of the amino acid citrulline and malic acid. It increases energy levels by removing ammonia from the body—a process that delays fatigue and improves recovery.</p> 

<br><br>
<p><b>CREATINE</b> provides muscles with the quick energy they need during workouts. It also pulls more water into the muscles for a greater pump, which turns on processes that lead to greater long-term muscle growth.</p> 

<br><br>
<p><b>GLYCEROL</b> is the backbone of triglycerides—the primary fats in our diet. It also has strong osmotic properties, attracting and binding large amounts of fluids like water for greater pump.</p>  

<br><br>
<p><b>TAURINE</b> is an amino acid that helps to increase muscle endurance and strength. It can increase blood flow to muscles by enhancing NO production. Taurine also draws water into your muscles for a bigger pump.</p>

<br><br>
<p><b>TYROSINE</b> is an amino acid that boosts energy, mood, and mental focus by producing hormones and neurotransmitters that boost your intensity during workouts.</p>
