<h1>How to do lunges</h1>

<br>
<p>Start in a standing position. Start by standing up straight with your feet hip-width apart and flat on the ground. Relax your shoulders and allow your shoulder blades to sink down towards your hips. Keep yourself in this position by flexing your abdominal muscles to keep your spine straight and stable.[2][3]
Throughout a lunge exercise your arms and hands can be in any position that helps you maintain your balance. Some people may prefer to put their hands on their hips while others may prefer to keep their arms held out to the side.
Ideally you should keep your back straight throughout a lunge exercise. This means you should try to keep your head upright while looking straight ahead. However, if you need to look down to ensure you’re in the right position, that’s okay.
Some people find it helpful to stare at a particular space on a wall (or another object) directly in front of them to help keep their balance.</p>

<p>Lift one foot off the floor and move it forward. Lift your right foot off the ground by bending your knee. Move your right foot forward like you’re taking a step. Place your right foot on the ground, heel first. Lean your body forward so you’re balanced on both feet, but keep your back and upper body straight.</p>

<p>
Lower your body until your right knee is at a 90-degree angle. While keeping your upper body and back straight, continue to move your body forward until your right upper leg (thigh) is parallel to the floor. Your right lower leg (shin) should be perpendicular to the floor. You may need to bend your hips slightly to stay in this position, but keep your back straight.[6][7]
Try not to move your right knee beyond your right foot. Your right knee should be positioned directly above your right ankle.
Once in the lunge position, your left (back) knee should also form a 90-degree angle, but your lower leg (shin) will be parallel to the ground while your upper leg (thigh) will be perpendicular to the ground.
Due to the position you’re in, you will only be able to keep your left toes on the ground. Your left heel will lift off the ground as you lean forward.</p>

<p>
Push yourself upwards with your right foot. Use your right foot to push yourself upwards. Return your body to the position you started in, standing straight with your feet hip-width apart.</p>

<p>
Repeat the forward lunge. Once you’ve completed a lunge with your right leg, you can either switch sides and perform a lunge with your left leg, or you can continue to work your right side. It doesn’t matter what order you do lunges in, but try to do an equal number of lunges using both your left and right side before you finish.[10][11]
Another alternative is to keep your right foot and left in the forward position, with your right foot flat on the ground, and unbend both your legs to move upwards.
In this position your legs will be in a v-shape with your right leg in front. In a standing position both your right and left feet will be flat on the ground.
After moving to this standing position, bend your legs and lower your body back into the lunge position. Repeat this several times and then switch to your left side.</p>
